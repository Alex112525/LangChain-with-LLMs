# LangChain with LLM's
This repository contains a collection of notebooks showcasing the combination of various Huggingface models with the Langchain framework. The notebooks serve as experiments to explore the responses and behaviors of different language models.

## Notebooks

#### 1. LangChain_promps_and_Chains: 
* This notebook uses HuggingFace's BERTin-GPT-j-6B-Alpaca language model to generate enhanced responses based on an initial text string. The main goal of the notebook is to improve the responses generated by the BERTin-GPT-j-6B-Alpaca model by using techniques such as Prompt Templates and Sequential Chains.
